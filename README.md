A very simple 2 files which goes through a all numbers from 0-1,000,000 and determines weather they are prime or not.Both files also record when they start there calcutions and when they end.This shows us the speed diffrence between python and C++.

C++ Takes 709.779 seconds (12 minutes) to find the prime numbers
Python Takes 3785.206161022186 seconds (63 minutes) seconds to find the prime numbers

This is because C++ is much faster than python due to it being a compiled lanague and python is interpreted.

To change the range of numbers that the files checks change the number in the file (in the C++ file at the if statement in the main function and the number in the while loop in the python file).

To run the files run the following commands:
    Compile the C++ file by running the command "g++ -o main main.cpp"
    Run the C++ file by running the command "./main"
    Run the python file by running the command "python main.py"
